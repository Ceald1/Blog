## Description:

Mothership C2 is my command and control server for managing and interacting with shell connections.

## Features:
Some features of Mothership include 
* Encryption for sending commands and their outputs
* Shells being managed and interacted with HTTP

## What is a C2?

A C2 server is a Command and Control server, it helps with controlling and commanding shell connections. C2 servers are used by APTs (advanced persistent threats) and by red teams

That's how they work simplified. There's much more that they can do like handle multiple connections at once or support encryption.

More coming soon...
